# About ICESat-2 Boreal Forest Biomass Mapping

## Overview

The ICESat-2 Boreal Forest Biomass Mapping project represents a groundbreaking initiative to map and monitor the vast boreal forests using advanced satellite technology. By combining data from NASA's ICESat-2 satellite with Landsat/Sentinel-2 imagery and the Copernicus GLO30 Digital Elevation Model, we're creating unprecedented insights into one of Earth's most crucial ecosystems.

## Mission

Our mission is to advance understanding of boreal forest dynamics and their role in the global carbon cycle through:
- Precise biomass estimation
- Long-term forest monitoring
- Climate change impact assessment
- Support for evidence-based policy decisions

## Key Technologies

### Satellite Systems
- **ICESat-2/ATLAS**: Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System
- **Landsat/Sentinel-2**: Multi-spectral imaging satellites
- **Copernicus GLO30**: High-resolution digital elevation model
