# Community

HySDS (Hybrid Cloud Science Data Processing System) is an open source science data processing system used across many large-scale Earth Science missions, data production, and analysis systems. This page provides information about the HySDS community, contributions, and resources.

## Community Overview

The HySDS community consists of:
- 50+ developers who have used HySDS for science data processing
- 30+ contributors to the HySDS Core
- 78 repositories in the organization
- 5 major versions in its evolution 
- 83 releases (as of April 2024)
- 13 active projects using HySDS in 2024
- 33 total NASA-funded projects to date

## Community Collaboration

The HySDS community follows these collaborative practices:

- **Regular Coordination**: Bi-weekly multi-mission coordination meetings across development and operations teams
- **Shared Benefits**: Community contributions including new features, bug fixes, and operational procedures from any project benefit all other projects
- **Active Communication**: Public GitHub, JIRA, Confluence wiki, and Slack channels enable multi-project sharing and collaboration
- **Open Source Approach**: Community software contributions drive multi-mission benefits

## Active Projects

HySDS is currently being used by several major NASA Earth Science missions and projects:

### Missions
- NISAR 
- SWOT
- SMAP with HySDS (SWH)
- SNWG OPERA
- OCO-2 reprocessing
- OCO-3 reprocessing

### Projects
- Multi-Mission Algorithm and Analysis Platform (MAAP)
- PO.DAAC SWODLR
- ASTER AVA
- ImgSPEC
- SISTER-SBG
- And more

## Key Innovations

The HySDS community has driven several significant innovations:

- First NASA Science Data System to demonstrate data production scalability to over 8,000 parallel compute nodes in the cloud
- First SDS to run data production using lower cost and volatile compute in AWS spot market
- Enabling first NASA EO Science Data Systems to do operations in the cloud
- First SDS to run data production spanning across AWS, on-premises, and NASA HECC Super Computing
- First SDS to span across AWS, GCP, Azure, & NASA HECC
- First SDS to integrate real-time faceted analytics with operations
