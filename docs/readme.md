## Overview

# `icesat2_boreal`

**Modeling and mapping of aboveground woody biomass for the circumpolar boreal forest using ICESat-2/ATLAS, Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2, and Copernicus GLO30 Digital Elevation Model**

This project is focused on the comprehensive modeling and mapping of aboveground woody biomass using advanced remote sensing technologies in the circumpolar boreal forest region. The work is funded by the NASA Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) and uses resources from NASA's Multi-Mission Algorithm and Analysis Platform (MAAP).

## Features

- **ICESat-2/ATLAS Data Integration**: Utilizes satellite data to capture forest biomass characteristics.
- **Landsat/Sentinel-2 Harmonization**: Combines data from multiple satellites to enhance resolution and accuracy.
- **GLO30 Digital Elevation Model**: Incorporates high-resolution elevation data from Copernicus services for improved biomass estimation.
- **Collaborative Development**: Engages multiple organizations and experts in geographical sciences and remote sensing.

## Use Cases

- **Biomass Estimation**: Assess and quantify aboveground woody biomass across the boreal forest.
- **Carbon Stock Monitoring**: Monitor changes in forest carbon stocks in response to environmental changes and management practices.
- **Climate Change Research**: Aid in understanding the impact of climate change on forest ecosystems in the boreal region.
- **Resource Management**: Provide critical data for forest management and conservation efforts.
- **Policy Making**: Support data-driven decisions in environmental policy and land use planning.

## Key Concepts

- **Aboveground Woody Biomass**: The total mass of living woody vegetation (trees, shrubs, etc.) above the soil surface.
- **Remote Sensing**: The use of satellite or aerial imagery to observe and measure features on the Earth's surface.
- **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)**: A 3D representation of a terrain's surface created from terrain elevation data.
- **Data Harmonization**: The process of integrating different datasets into a consistent, comparable format.
